        Hi James I would just like to say a massive thank you for sorting out our windows having just moved house many of them wearnt even opening &amp; some wouldn't close properly without a struggle,having been told we would need new ones by a window company which would cost thousands was a fright as we just don't have the money at the moment,then I saw your advert in Horsham Pages I called you &amp; was able to get them working &amp; sorted at a fraction of the cost, job well done would highly recommend Window Wizard.
