        <h3>Welcome to the window wizard horsham</h3>
        <p class="intro">
          I'm an independent double glazing repair specialist, who offers a repair service most window company's are not able to offer at a fraction of the cost of new double glazed windows and doors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having been a window fitter for over 10 years, I decided to set up on my own in 2011 offering an alternative to replacing windows doors &amp; conservatories I could not understand why everything had to be replaced &amp; not repaired.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know window &amp; doors can cost hundreds if not thousands, all moving parts &amp; double glazed sealed units can all be replaced i.e. window hinges, handles, window locks, cylinders/barrels, multipoint door locks, patio wheels, patio tracks all of this bringing your window &amp; doors back to life which is much much more cost effective than replacing the frames &amp; glass.

            Hi James I would just like to say a massive thank you for sorting out our windows having just moved house many of them wearnt even opening &amp; some wouldn't close properly without a struggle,having been told we would need new ones by a window company which would cost thousands was a fright as we just don't have the money at the moment,then I saw your advert in Horsham Pages I called you &amp; was able to get them working &amp; sorted at a fraction of the cost, job well done would highly recommend Window Wizard.
